About
-----
Programmers tend to have weird habbits and I don't know why...

My friends don't want to waste time diciding where to eat, so they spend even more time to find a way to pick a random restaurant.

And what2eat became the final solution. A simple Bash script to help you figure out what to eat tonight.

All choices are in Chinese, but they are easy to understand. So you can make your own choice list easily. For buddies in Xiamen No.1 Middle School, there's also an incomplete list for you. We'll update it from time to time, and if you want to contribute, feel free to do so (both patches and pull requests are OK; I'll merge them manually).

Plan
----
- [x] Weighted shuffling
- [ ] Dynamically adjust weight of each choice
- [ ] Decide what to order
- [ ] Output only the first few lines of the shuffled result
